## Abstract

Short summary of the project and the work conducted

## Table of Contents

[[_TOC_]]

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1	Background
Necessary background to your work….

Chapter 1 presents….. 

Chapter 2 presents…..

## 2	Literature review
If you have conducted literature review, this would be the point to present other researchers work in that field.

## 3	Theory
If necessary please present theory in this section.

This math is inline $`a^2+b^2=c^2`$.

## 4	Methodology
How was your approach to solve the given problem/task.
This will include descriptions of the HW used as well as the SW.

This is an example how to include code snippet:
```python
def function():
    #indenting works just fine in the fenced code block
    s = "Python code"
    print s
```

Example how to draw a table:

| Left Aligned | Centered | Right Aligned |
| :---         | :---:    | ---:          |
| Cell 1       | Cell 2   | Cell 3        |
| Cell 4       | Cell 5   | Cell 6        |
| OpAmp 741    | 2        | 1.00          |


## 5	Results
Here you should present your results.
